Even now, this builds for me after doing:

  apt-get install libxext-dev xutils-dev

To build:

1)  Run the program 'xmkmf' to generate the makefile;

2)  Type 'make';

That's all. You should now be able to run 'puzzle'.
Type:

    puzzle --help

for help.

do their thing, to bring them up to date we should link
with an image library to load an image file into a pixmap
and *then* play our games with the tiles.
